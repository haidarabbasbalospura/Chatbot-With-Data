              "[Document(metadata={'source': 'Bx7I06w6vVA'}, page_content=\"just yesterday Chachi PT launched a brand new pretty incredible feature called canvas this feature feels akin to cla's artifacts and it could do a whole bunch of stuff so that's what we're going to go over today the way to think about canvas is a new way to collaborate with chat GPT you type a prompt and instead of it just being in one single chat it opens up this separate window where you can ask chat gbt to edit certain parts of text or code you can ask it to update you can ask it to add comes a whole bunch of cool stuff so I'm briefly going to tell you about it then we're just going to play around with it so everybody already has access to chat GPT with canvas and what I really like about it is the fact that they didn't say it's coming soon they just released it the day that they announced it so if you click in the drop down here it is GPT 40 with canvas beta and they said for now everybody with a pro or Enterprise account will get access to it and then as soon as it leaves beta every free user will also get access to it there are two main use cases that canvas looks to help with writing and coding and obviously I definitely want want to test out the coding aspects which we will do right after this one thing I found really interesting is they actually trained GPT 40 to collaborate so this is not just the base GPT 40 model with some code wrapper around it this is actually a different version of GPT 40 that recognizes when it should use canvas so for writing it includes suggesting edits adjusting the length changing the reading level adding final polish and adding emojis for coding it reviews code it can add logs add comments fix bugs and port to a different language which is pretty cool and as I mentioned GPT 40 was trained to use canvas so to do that they developed these core behaviors triggering the canvas for writing and coding so that's obviously just getting it going generating diverse content types making targeted edits which is super interesting so rather than redoing the entire output every time you can actually just select a certain piece of the content and it will update that only all right so now I just want to test it out and show you what it's like to use it but before I do that I actually want to speak to something that I think a lot of companies that are built on chat GPT should be nervous about now open aai as a company has always described itself as a platform company they are going to give other developers the tools that they need to build amazing AI applications but if I'm an AI company and I'm seeing this I would be a little bit nervous and this feels very analogous to what I went through at my previous company so at my previous company we built a lot of our infrastructure on top of a company called twilio twilio provides telepan servic and they were truly a platform company all they did was provide an API until they didn't and we built an entire suest software on top of twilio using SMS and phone calls and other things and then one day twilio started competing with us they started building on top of their own platform and so if you've watched this Channel at all you know I've talked about platform risk in the past if you build your entire business on top of somebody else's API you are at platform risk if they decide to change their policies increase their price compete directly with you because they saw a really successful business model they will do that there is nothing actually preventing them from doing that and in fact they get all of this incredible data they get to see what all of these companies build on top of their platform and then they can cherry-pick the best ones and recreate it this is a tried andrue model for platform companies and so now with canvas I'm looking at continue and other AI based idees and they should be nervous right now because this is essentially the first step in the direction to compete with those companies all right so enough of that let me know what you think of platform risk building on top of open AI in the comments All right so we have it GPT 40 with canvas let's just play around with it first of course let's get it to write the snake game now one thing that canvas doesn't do is execute code and I believe artifacts does do that so that's one thing that it's missing all right so here it is so it popped open a separate little area of the window window and it looks like a code editor we can delete stuff we can add it back easily here's the actual conversation over here but it removed a big part of what would have been there which is the code and place it in the separate window which I love so we have the game Snake we can't execute it plus that's not the point of this video so I'm not going to do that but let's see rather than these colors so we simply highlight then down in the right corner we have all of the different options so add comments add logs fix bugs port to a different language and code review so instead of doing that I'm just going to highlight it click ask chat GPT and I'm going to say change these colors to something else so it should yep look at that that's really cool so it just changed these colors everything else stayed the same you see the little editing update right here in the actual chat window and that's it I've updated the colors to new shades for better variation all right so that's how the basics work so what I could also do is highlight p game and ask it to use a different Library which would really change the entire application so use a different library and I love so now it's using turtle and it actually has to change a lot of things in the code and it knew to do that which is fantastic and I love the little animation that it has where it's just highlighting the code as it's changing it so I've updated the code to use the turtle library inside of pame let me know if you need further modifications all right so that's what that looks like but there's not many comments in this code right now so let's ask it to add comments so first let's ask it to add comments to this set of lines of code right there so I'm simply going to come over here and I'm going to click add comments and actually I was wrong it automatically adds comments to the entire document which is kind of weird cuz I only highlighted these but now it's adding a ton of comments but let's say we don't like this let's say we don't like python so let's Port it to a different language so I'm going to click port to different language and look we have a slider PHP C++ python keep current JavaScript typescript Java let's do JavaScript so I simply select that and it should rewrite it in JavaScript so easy so it's done now it's in JavaScript now let's try porting it to something like C++ Yep this looks like C++ all right thanks to the sponsor of this video vulture reap the benefits of the world's largest

again to vulture for sponsoring this video all right now let's try fixing bugs so I'm actually going to switch it back cuz I don't know C++ very well at all I'm going to switch it back to python now let's add some bugs so right here for the move snake I'm going to use up twice and let's see if it's able to catch that so I go over here again and I look for the fix bugs icon I click that and let's see what it says so it's interesting it's actually changing a lot of the code already uh which I don't know why it would have to do that to fix the bugs because there was really only one bug let's see if it's able to fix that one and it did okay the down movement Direction was incorrectly assigned to up now something interesting is as I mentioned it changed a lot of the code which is not exactly what I wanted but that's fine let's see what happens if we just do fix bug one more time let's see if it just keeps finding bugs and maybe the way it was programmed it will just always find a bug with it yeah so it's definitely changing the code again just a little bit but it is changing it especially down here in the main game Loop it is changing it quite a bit I reviewed the code fix a bug where the game did not reset properly upon wall Collision okay so it looks like maybe it's thinking uh iterative improvements to the game is the same as a bug fix that's okay all right now let's add some logs first let's just try to add logs to something that I highlight I wonder if it's going to do that nope it's adding logs to everywhere so it doesn't seem like just highlighting the code does anything unless you are using that as GPT feature so it added a bunch of logs now let's see if I can remove the logs now remove the logs okay yeah so it is removing the logs all right I mean this seems pretty cool I think this is very basic to start with but I like it and it's definitely much better to kind of go through the iteration process of the code here and then paste it into VSS code but honestly this is kind of what continue and other IDE AI coders already do so they still have a long ways to go but it seems clear that they are definitely heading in the direction of competing with AI coding assistant all right now let's try some creative writing and let's see what it does so I'm going to start a new chat so write me a story about strawberries becoming intelligent intelligence I miswrote that okay so we have a story and just like I expected it should have output a new canvas area of the page so does this story capture the essence of what you imagine let me know if you'd like to make any changes so just like normal we can come in here we could delete stuff we could add remove this is fully editable and just like normal you can highlight certain areas and do ask chat GPT just like that but we're going to wait on that let's go down to the options we have so suggest adust edits adjust the length reading level add final polish and add emojis so let's first do suggest edits this is really cool okay so it's going to highlight different areas and kind of similar looking to Google Docs it gives you little comments that you can actually accept or decline so here consider adding more Vivid description of the setting to draw the reader in more effectively and create a stronger atmosphere so let's do that so it should rewrite that part there we go really good let's do it again right here so this says the Nanobots were designed to enhance neural Connections in living organisms and they worked their way into the strawberries nesting in amongst the seeds that dotted their red skin this sentence could benefit from a bit more explanation about why the Nanobots were designed this way okay let's try it all right now it says originally intended for medical research to improve brain function so it gives more background story so that's great so I'm going to decline these other ones and now let's adjust the length and again we have another slider so I want it to be shorter and it should rewrite the whole thing it's really cool the little subtle animations that they have so here we go much shorter let's see if we go even shorter than that so I'm going to go shortest all right and what happens if we do it again let's find out so I'm going to adjust the length again and go shortest again I wonder if it's going to go shorter or just keep it at the same length Okay so it did go a little shorter let's try to go shorter again just want to see where the limits of the functionality are yeah so it'll keep actually just shortening it so now let's go longer okay great let's try something else right now I don't know the current reading level but it's going to keep it there let's go to the kindergarden level so it's going to rewrite everything and just use simpler words easier grammar to read Etc so one day special rain fell on some strawberries yeah so this looks very good now let's change the reading level to graduate school yeah so they're definitely using longer more sophisticated words definitely looks like this would not be possible to read by by a kindergartener so that's really cool now let's go back to a kindergarten level and let's see what happens if we select kindergarten level after selecting kindergarten level so there we go and let's select kindergarten level again yeah it looks about the same so it just kind of roted didn't necessarily make it even more basic and that would make sense so let's go back and let's do high school level all right there we go now let's add emojis now funny thing about the ad emojis feature it's pretty much useless I mean unless that is exact ly what you're looking for it to do but why would you do that and Sam Alman posted a funny poll on Twitter yesterday is ADD emojis and canvas the best feature open AI has ever shipped yes and yes and so of course the answer is yes so there we go it added emojis now I'm going to say remove the emojis over here o i see a lot of Errors actually so here's rain just out of nowhere I think I saw a misspelling somewhere in here but I'm not seeing it now so maybe it corrected it and let's go to add final polish now hopefully it corrects this rain at the beginning it did okay good and it added a title now so this is really cool so I've come to adore. comom and I'm going to give it some problems I'm going to have it fix bugs so I'm going to highlight the code that they have I'm going to copy it and the problem is uninitialized variables and Fields so let's switch back to Canvas and I'm going to say fix bugs in this using canvas I don't know if I actually have to do that we'll see yep okay so it did open it up contact bug fix so let's see it's writing the code out first good and it didn't actually tell me what the bugs were here we go I've addressed a few issues in the original code initialization of done in the complete procedure done was not being explicitly initialized to false null contact definition and get by name initialization so these seem like what needed to be fixed so I think it did catch this c. name length on line 86 the contacts. complete not initialize let's look yeah the complete procedure I think that fixed it obviously I'm not checking exactly but it seems like it definitely identified it so that's the new feature Chachi PT with canvas looks very cool still very basic but I think if they continue to iterate they're going to be competing with a lot of other AI products built on top of them either way let me know what you think of canvas let me know what you think of platform risk of being a company built on top of open ai's API and if you enjoyed this video please consider giving a like And subscribe and I'll see see you in the next one\")]"

at English pod my name is Marco and my name is Katherine hello everyone today Marco what are we talking about well today we are um not really in the best mood what you mean we're kind of sad we're kind of um nervous we're we're not feeling very well yeah it's a it's a cloudy day maybe that's why at the blues the blues so yeah that's what we're talking about today we're going to have a lot of different descriptive words to express of maybe feeling sad or maybe you're angry or you're nervous or something like that okay well this is a very useful lesson hopefully you're not feeling this way but if you have to talk about someone who is got lots of words for you but first we're going to preview a couple in today's vocabulary preview vocabulary preview all right so today on vocabulary preview we're going to look at two words words and uh the first one is a way of saying that you feel sad so basically I'm feeling down okay down you might have heard this before because it's the opposite of the word up exactly so you're not feeling up happy looking up you're feeling down this is another word for sad like Marco said or you can also say I'm I'm a bit down today right yeah I'm a bit down today or you look really down are you okay yeah so you look sad are you is everything okay so down so now another feel feeling or a way that a person is feeling maybe that person is Grouchy would you please stop talking so loud Marco I think uh you have no I'm I'm seriously don't be grouchy Catherine jeez no so grouchy is is a way someone acts usually when they're in a bad mood right so it's not like really angry you're not angry but uh you're not very happy either and you're not very nice to people so there's a very famous TV character called Oscar the Grouch on Sesame Street look for him on YouTube or Yoku and uh he's very very good uh for learning about this feeling grouchy because he's a grouchy guy yeah he's always angry or not never happy basically right he's always complaining about something so that word again is Grouchy all right so after taking a look at these two words we're ready now to listen to our dialogue for the first time let's see what this dialogue is about if maybe they're grouchy or maybe just sad fine okay I'll talk to you later bye Carrie are you okay you seem a bit down I just got off the phone with my boyfriend he's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing it's so hard to talk to him at times maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something he does have a pretty nerve-wracking job you know yeah but he's always in a really foul mood I tried to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but he he always shuts down and brushes me off men are like that you know they can feel nervous anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness I guess you're right what do you think I should do he wasn't always as grouchy you know talk to him try to cheer him up when he's down and if that doesn't work I say get rid of him and get a new one you are something else you know that all right so two girls talking about guys I guess guys have a a bad temper sometimes right I think anyone can have a bad temper but we're talking today about one of uh the boyfriend of one of these girls who has a very bad temper and has been very grouchy recently mhm and that's why she's feeling a bit down mhm so let's take a look at those words now in language takeaway language takeaway all right so in today's language takeaway we've got some wonderful words for you words that are very good for describing stress or having anx anxiety and the first of these words is something you hear all the time especially with young people right somebody is stressed out my gosh Marco I'm so stressed out I have 10 homework assignments to do and S softball practice and my mom wants me to help cook dinner tonight wow you really are stressed out I am well I don't have any homework and I don't live with my mom but uh being stressed out is usually something you feel when you have too much stuff to do mhm M so maybe you can be stressed out because U of school like in your case or maybe at work you have a lot of things to do or a project to finish right exactly and I just want to point out here that you can say I'm stressed or I'm feeling stressed but uh commonly in spoken English so when you're talking to your friends you hear this much more often stressed out stressed out he's really stressed out lately mhm all right so we're stressed out or another word that kind of means the same is this is nerve-wracking nerve wracking so nerves are those things in our body that help us feel things right and so something that racks our nerves makes us very very tense very anxious very uncomfortable okay so it makes you very nervous right so there are some movies that are nerve-wracking for example suspense movies like Hitchcock's movies like psycho or the birds or like like maybe saw o nerve-wracking also some people think roller coasters are nerve-wracking they're very very uh anxious when they ride roller coasters right so let's listen to a couple of more examples of in different situations where we can use this phrase nerve-wracking example one I think being a doctor is one of the most nerve-wracking jobs in the world example two skydiving was one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of my life I almost had a heart attack example three the final match between Brazil and Italy was incredibly nerve-racking and there's another way to describe this feeling again it's a little bit different but very very similar we can say someone is feeling on edge on edge so this person was feeling on edge uh but what does that mean exactly you're like at the edge why do you have to ask so many questions okay listen this is B sick okay Marco all right all right are you are you mocking me on edge today all right so someone who is on edge is easily angered right so it's very easy to make this person upset or angry mhm someone who just quit smoking might be on edge that means it's very very easy to get them to be upset wow so yeah you are on edge right exactly he's on edge or he seems on edge doesn't he mhm M okay very good wow these uh three words that we've just looked at are really interesting and very very useful I guess you can describe many different situations or a person that's going through these feelings right absolutely I think there is a thousand ways to describe being nervous or anxious or upset so maybe we should take take another listen to today's dialogue and figure out how exactly we use these words and we come back we talking about some other phrases that are useful okay I'll talk to you later bye Carrie are you okay you seem a bit down I just got off the phone with my boyfriend he's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing it's so hard to talk to him at times maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something he does have a pretty nerve-wracking job you know yeah but he's always in a really foul mood I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but he he always shuts down and brushes me off men are like that you know they can feel nervous anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness I guess you're right what do you think I should do he wasn't always as grouchy you know talk to him try to cheer him up when he's down and if that doesn't work I say get rid of him and get a new one you are something else you know that all right great so now that we're back we can start with a couple of different phrases now on fluency Builder fluency Builder all right so Marco here's the big question what makes you lose your temper H I think what makes me lose my temper very very easily is uh like a dirty house or like a dirty room really you're in neat freak not really neat freak but like if it's not at least semi my clean you know it really it really B bothers me okay so this great phrase lose your temper or lose one's temper is is a phrase we use in English to describe getting angry all right so maybe you're okay you're a little frustrated with something but someone does something like throws all of their clothes on the floor and Marco here says oh that's it I'm tired of this you're always throwing your clothes on the floor and that's that's an example of Marco losing his temper what about you what makes you lose your temper you hear this what is that oh drilling construction when people when people tap tap tap tap tap tap tap or when they like stomp their feet feet feet when they nervous when they make noise yeah and so slowly it's like okay fine calm down it's okay okay no seriously stop it serious and then all of a sudden I just can't stand it anymore explode exactly so all right so that what's so that's what makes you lose your temper I'll be sure to um keep my eye out of for that not tap my pen all right all right so okay you lose your temper and now uh there are situations sometimes where you need to brush someone off all right or when you get brushed off and that's not very good feeling but uh this phrase to brush someone off you've heard the word brush before it's the word that we use to to you know brush your hair or brush your teeth exactly when you brush someone off it's like saying that you're ignoring them yeah so you ignore them or you basically tell them to go away very subtly sometimes or very directly exactly and so to brush someone off is to avoid their company and so a lot of times when people are angry they like to be alone so they brush you off mhm so I could say hey did you want to go see that movie tonight uh no I can't I uh have to do something tonight and then Marco walks away while we're talking he's brushing me off he's ignoring me yeah so uh it happens and also maybe some people can make up excuses and that's also brushing someone off right right exactly so to brush someone off or he brushed me off doesn't feel good all right and well all of these all of these bad feelings brushing somebody off maybe you feel stressed out in the end you always need a good friend to cheer you up right and that's what this dialogue is all about exactly and so friends are actually the people that do that the best or family I think and uh well we can break this phrase down because uh most of it's pretty clear but cheer might be a new word for some of our listeners maybe we've heard of the term cheerleader you know like give me an a hey hey so cheer or people cheering or cheers when the beer so cheer is like happiness so someone who can cheer you up is someone who makes you happy remember that down we had earlier I'm feeling down we're trying to cheer someone up we trying to make them go up and be happy exactly so you want to cheer up your friends or maybe if you're feeling a bit down a family member will try and cheer you up do you need someone to cheer you up Marco yes I do let's go have a drink and eat some pop CN and be cheered up that's what cheers me up or chocolate always cheers me up oh I know there's some of that all right so we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases but the last sentence of the dialogue is maybe a little bit uh strange right when she says you are something else you know that uh something what like U is she an alien is she a monkey what does she mean when she says you are something else that's a great question well this might be a little bit hard to understand at first but she's saying I can't believe you mhm she's like there's no one like you you're really something else you know that so it's kind of like a joke but uh what she's saying is I can't believe you you just want to go on and encourage me to find another boy you're like you're unbelievable so it could be is it on a positive note or can it be both positive and negative well here we've got two friends who are using it so it's a positive note but she's kind of making fun of her saying I can't believe you um but it can be negative more negative fighting with her boyfriend and and her boyfriend cheats on her and she's like you're really something else you know you are something else you know that it's like there's no comparison you're the worst yeah exactly so yeah it really depends on how this is used and what the tone of voice is so how someone says it uh but in this case I think it's a kind of a joke joke but uh it's it's a positive right very interesting it's very spoken English as you say because all the words that we see there they're pretty simple but the context or the connotation the meaning is very very different from the actual words right exactly mhm all right so let's listen to this dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more okay I'll talk to you later bye Carrie are you okay you seem a bit down I just got off the phone with my boyfriend he's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing it's so hard to talk to him at times maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something he does have a pretty nerve-wracking job you know yeah yeah but he's always in a really foul mood I tried to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but he he always shuts down and brushes me off men are like that you know they can feel nervous anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness I guess you're right what do you think I should do he wasn't always as grouchy you know talk to him try to cheer him up when he's down and if that doesn't work I say get rid of him and get a new one you have something else you know that so Catherine are you a grouchy person are you happy do you have a bad temper oh these are well very interesting questions Marco thank you for asking no the first the first them am I grouchy no not very only before 9:00 a.m. you're not a morning person not a morning person so I'm very grouchy in the morning but uh I'm generally pretty good about losing my temper it doesn't happen very often really um but I do get frustrated with things like tapping or when people eat with their mouth open oh yeah that's terrible I hate that as well yeah I can't stand it or uh I really don't like when people bite their nails ooh it's kind of uh it also makes me lose my temper I don't know it more than makes me lose my temper it's kind of annoying right it is annoying so what makes you really lose your temper we say what makes you blow your top think about it a volcano really grinds my gears yeah um I would say the worst is uh when somebody lies to me like straight in my face like I know they're lying I know you're lying and he still just lies straight at me I agree so what's something that really cheers you up because we talked about like going out with a friend maybe helps you helps you cheer up but is there one thing some kind of Remedy I have actually I like to go shopping when I'm really yeah I mean I won't buy anything like clothes or anything like that usually I'll get maybe something for somebody else or for the house or something it's very strange helps you like clear your mind yeah it's just like uh walking around and spending a little bit of money I don't know it's kind of a good remedy yeah I think so what about you what what cheers you up I kind of like to organize things really y so if I'm really angry or really upset about something I'll um alphabetize all
